## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![image info](./Resources/deliverable1.png)

Based on the individual p-values for each variable, the only values that were less than 0.05 were for vehicle length and ground clearance. This means that vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model, or that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg.
